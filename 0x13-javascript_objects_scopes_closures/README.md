# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Tasks
### [0. Rectangle #0]()
Write an empty class *Rectangle* that defines a rectangle
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class.

### [1. Rectangle #1]()
Write a class *Rectangle* the defines a rectangle
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class.
* The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
* Initialize the instance attribute *width* with the value *w*
* Initialize the instance attribute *height* with the value *h*

### [2. Rectangle #2]()
Write a class *Rectangle* the defines a rectangle
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class.
* The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
* Initialize the instance attribute *width* with the value *w*
* Initialize the instance attribute *height* with the value *h*
* if *w* or *h* is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

### [3. Rectangle #3]()
Write a class *Rectangle* the defines a rectangle
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class.
* The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
* Initialize the instance attribute *width* with the value *w*
* Initialize the instance attribute *height* with the value *h*
* if *w* or *h* is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
* Create an instance method called *print()* that prints the rectangle using the character *X*

### [4. Rectangle #3]()
Write a class *Rectangle* the defines a rectangle
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class.
* The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
* Initialize the instance attribute *width* with the value *w*
* Initialize the instance attribute *height* with the value *h*
* if *w* or *h* is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
* Create an instance method called *print()* that prints the rectangle using the character *X*
* create an instance method called *rotate()* that exchanges the *width* and *height* of the rectangle
* Create an instance method called *double()* that multiplies the *width* and the *height* of the rectangle by 2.

### [5. Square #0]()
Write a class *Square* that defines a Square and inherits from *Rectangle* of *4-rectangle.js*:
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class and *extends*
* The constructor must take 1 argument: size
* The constructor of *Rectancgle* must be class (by using *super()*)

### [6. Square #1]()
Write a class *Square* that defines a square and inherits from *Square* of *5-square.js*:
* You must use the *class* notation for defining your class and *extends*
* Create an instance method called *charPrint(c)* that prints the rectangle using the character *c*
	* If *c* is undefined, use the character *X*

### [7. Ocurrences]()
Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.
* Prototype: *exports.nbOccurrences = function (list, searchElement)*

### [8. Esrever]()
Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list
* Prototype: *exports.esrever = function (list)*
* You are not allowed to use the built-in method reverse.

### [9. Log me]()
Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
* Prototype: *exports.logMe = function (item)*
* Output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>

### [10. Number conversion]()
Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument
* Prototype: *exports.converter = function (base)*
* You are not allowed to import any file
* You are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc...)
